**#7: Do Imtiyano & Rodieeno come online?**
Yes, they do. They’re regularly active on Discord, usually for editing videos, gaming, and sometimes joining voice chat to hang out and talk with their fans.

**#8: How can I talk with IMTIYANO or RODIEENO?**
They join text or voice channels whenever they’re free to interact with members and fans. This server was created so they could connect with their community. Talkshows are organized frequently to give everyone a chance to talk with them.

However, since there are many fans, it’s not possible to host a talkshow with everyone at once, doing so could cause server outages and ruin the experience. That’s why talkshows are held often but with a limited number of participants.
